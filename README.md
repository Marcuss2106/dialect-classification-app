AccentMe is an open research tool to study and automatically classify regional and social dialects from short speech samples. The project is currently in a data-collection phase: we collect volunteer voice recordings + minimal metadata to build a training dataset for later model experiments.

## Why collect volunteer samples?
Good dialect classifiers require varied, real-world speech across ages, gender expressions, regions, and recording conditions. Volunteer-contributed data helps us:
- Reduce dataset bias
- Improve model generalization
- Evaluate fairness across groups
All contributions are voluntary and protected by the consent procedure below.


We only use your recording and metadata to train and evaluate dialect classification models. Personal identifying information is not required; provide only what you’re comfortable sharing.

## How samples will be used.
- Train and evaluate machine-learning models for dialect classification.
- Analyze dataset demographics and recording conditions to identify bias.
- Derived datasets (features, embeddings) may be used for experiments; raw audio is not publicly released without explicit consent.
- When we publish papers or demos, we will describe dataset statistics, anonymization steps, and ethics review.
